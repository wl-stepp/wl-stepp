### The skiing biophysicist

I'm currently working on an adaptive approach to microscopy of various biological systems. Originally coming from problems of single-molecule tracking using Matlab I have now shifted to using Python and ventured a little bit into Rust. In order to be able to customize Micro-Manager with some Plugins I have also done some programming in Java.
I like making GUIs
